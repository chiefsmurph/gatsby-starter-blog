If you spend just a minute browsing [penny](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/) [trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/) forums online, you will undoubtably soon find that the internet is buzzing about two biotech stocks in particular: BPMX and AKER.  These two stocks have been my main holds for the past few months.  In this article I would like to document why I think they are great holds in the short-term and long-term.

First off I should say I have relatively little interest in fundamental analysis of penny stocks.  Of course it is necessary to understand the company to determine whether I think a stock is undervalued, but I like to purchase stocks like these just because of their current prices and the sentiment behind them.  The real challenge with these are going to be deciding when to walk away.  Especially because I could see both of these companies having upward momentum in the long-term.  Analysts predictions are much more conservative then my own and that is going to create a tricky situation when the summer roles around.

## BPMX
*first over the counter minocycline acne treatment*

* About a month ago - when they were < 20 cents - they let their option to reverse split expire.  This shows confidence they will reach $1 by the end of the year.
* 19 institutional investors at over 33% ownersip.
* 2 great products in development that are close to release.
* Potential partnership in the works?
* Upcoming dates of interest: 1) ROTH Conference - March 12, 2018 after hours 2) Earnings & possible approval date - March 22, 2018 3) Completion of BPX-01 and BPX-04, clinical trials Date: June 2018
* Analysts price targets: $1 - $1.50

## AKER
*first over the counter chlamydia testing*

* FDA approval has to come 90 days after their last communication (Dec 31 or Jan 1).  Coming soon?
* Deal with Planned Parenthood?
* Long-term positive outlook, just listen to this person on The Internet: `I don't really know what to expect from their Q4 reports....but the Q1 should be pretty decent with the addition of their cholesterol tests. Q2 should hopefully start to see the Chlamydia test sales but also some drop in margin due to the production of the Chlamydia tests. Q3 and Q4 should be huge. Lastly, they have 4 devices going to FDA approval this year and 3 more next year. That's a pretty solid pipeline.` - [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/831f49/aker_day_3/)
* Analysts price targets: $4

Both companies are waiting on FDA approval and if [JAGX is any indicator](http://www.baystreet.ca/stockstowatch/3269/Jaguar-Health-Stock-Explodes-on-FDA-News) (up 150% on news) - then good things are in store.

Another ticker that I have had my eye on is NVCN @ 19 cents (price target: $1.50 - 2.25 / $16!).  They have never reverse split.  I had an order in earlier this week, and because it did not get filled within 10 minutes I canceled it.  Unfortunately it ended up at 24 cents by the end of the day.  I may time a move from these stocks over to that one.
